        <h1>An Interest of Mine: Drawing</h1>
        <p>Date Published: Oct 10th, 2024</p>

        <p>I've been into drawing/sketching ever since I was a kid. When I was really little, my parents would always buy me see-through sketching paper so I could trace over the characters in books that I had. For a while I, around middle school, I stopped drawing all together. During my Freshman year of high school I casually picked it back up trying to improve on my actual skills. I enrolled in some "Intro to Drawing" classes during my sophomore year and starting drawing more often in my free time. Since then, I draw whenever I get the chance and/or inspiration. I feel that since then my skills have improved pretty nicely. However, I still have a lot of room to get better. I tend to just stick to sketching and drawing as being colorblind makes the act of working with colors and lighting relatively difficult. Although, recently I have been experimenting with colors in some of the things I'm working on. I'm getting better at lighting too, but depending on the shade of both the light and the shadows, it can get pretty difficult so I tend to stick to grayscale color and lighting. Below are some pictures of my most recent project. They show the process that I went through to reach the final product. To start I drew the sketch, then digitally lined it, and then colored it digitally as well.</p>
