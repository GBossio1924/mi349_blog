                <p class="post-text">My name is Grant and welcome to the About Page for my MI349 Blog. I'm writing this blog website for a class assignment. Right now it's just some basic HTML with very little CSS that I used to format the images on the Blog page a little nicer than just the full resolution image taking up the entire webpage. I understand the HTML pretty well I think, but I'm hoping to learn more about CSS soon as that's what helps style and build the actual website, the thing that makes the site appealing. I'm excited to learn more about the subject too as I'm a senior here and a computer science major. It's been a while since I've used HTML and CSS so this class has been excited so far and I'm brushing up on some old skills.</p>
